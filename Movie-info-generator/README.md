# Movie Information Assistant

The **Movie Information Assistant** is a Streamlit-based web app that helps users find detailed information about a movie. By entering the title of a movie, users can instantly get relevant information generated by Google's Generative AI model, making it easier to explore and learn about different films.

## Features

- **Movie Title Input**: Users can input the title of any movie to get detailed information about it.
- **AI-Powered Information**: The app generates comprehensive details about the movie, including plot, cast, director, and more.
- **Dynamic Information Display**: Once the movie title is entered, the app generates and displays the information in a clean, user-friendly format.

## Requirements

Before running the app, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `streamlit`: For the web app interface.
- `google-generativeai`: For interacting with Google's Generative AI model.

You can install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install streamlit google-generativeai
```

## Setup

1. **API Key**: The app uses Google's Generative AI, which requires an API key. To obtain an API key, visit [Google Cloud AI](https://cloud.google.com/ai) and create a project to generate the API key.
   - Once you have the API key, replace the placeholder in the code with your own API key: 
   ```python
   configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
   ```

2. **Run the App**:
   After setting up the API key, you can run the app with the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Access the App**:
   Open the provided local URL in your browser to interact with the app.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Movie Title**: Users enter the title of a movie they want more information about.
2. **AI Processing**: The app sends the movie title to Google's Generative AI model, which then generates relevant details about the movie, such as plot, cast, director, and other important aspects.
3. **Display Information**: The app returns the generated information and displays it in an easily readable format.

## Example Use Cases

- **Movie Information**: Enter a movie title, such as "Inception," and get a detailed summary, including plot, cast, director, and more.
- **Explore New Movies**: Use the app to explore and learn about movies you are interested in, including upcoming releases or old classics.
